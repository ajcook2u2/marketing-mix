InputCollect <- robyn_inputs(InputCollect = InputCollect, hyperparameters = hyperparameters)
print(InputCollect)
#### 2a-4: Fourth (optional), model calibration / add experimental input
## Guide for calibration
# 1. Calibration channels need to be paid_media_spends or organic_vars names.
# 2. We strongly recommend to use Weibull PDF adstock for more degree of freedom when
# calibrating Robyn.
# 3. We strongly recommend to use experimental and causal results that are considered
# ground truth to calibrate MMM. Usual experiment types are identity-based (e.g. Facebook
# conversion lift) or geo-based (e.g. Facebook GeoLift). Due to the nature of treatment
# and control groups in an experiment, the result is considered immediate effect. It's
# rather impossible to hold off historical carryover effect in an experiment. Therefore,
# only calibrates the immediate and the future carryover effect. When calibrating with
# causal experiments, use calibration_scope = "immediate".
# 4. It's controversial to use attribution/MTA contribution to calibrate MMM. Attribution
# is considered biased towards lower-funnel channels and strongly impacted by signal
# quality. When calibrating with MTA, use calibration_scope = "immediate".
# 5. Every MMM is different. It's highly contextual if two MMMs are comparable or not.
# In case of using other MMM result to calibrate Robyn, use calibration_scope = "total".
# 6. Currently, Robyn only accepts point-estimate as calibration input. For example, if
# 10k$ spend is tested against a hold-out for channel A, then input the incremental
# return as point-estimate as the example below.
# 7. The point-estimate has to always match the spend in the variable. For example, if
# channel A usually has $100K weekly spend and the experimental holdout is 70%, input
# the point-estimate for the $30K, not the $70K.
# 8. If an experiment contains more than one media variable, input "channe_A+channel_B"
# to indicate combination of channels, case sensitive.
# calibration_input <- data.frame(
#   # channel name must in paid_media_vars
#   channel = c("facebook_S",  "tv_S", "facebook_S+search_S", "newsletter"),
#   # liftStartDate must be within input data range

#   liftEndDate = as.Date(c("2018-06-10", "2018-06-03", "2018-07-20", "2017-12-31")),
#   # Provided value must be tested on same campaign level in model and same metric as dep_var_type
#   liftAbs = c(400000, 300000, 700000, 200),

#   spend = c(421000, 7100, 350000, 0),
#   # Confidence: if frequentist experiment, you may use 1 - pvalue
#   confidence = c(0.85, 0.8, 0.99, 0.95),
#   # KPI measured: must match your dep_var

#### Step 1: Load data
## Check simulated dataset or load your own dataset

head(dt_simulated_weekly)
## Check holidays from Prophet
# 59 countries included. If your country is not included, please manually add it.
# Tipp: any events can be added into this table, school break, events etc.

#### Step 2a: For first time user: Model specification in 4 steps
#### 2a-1: First, specify input variables
## All sign control are now automatically provided: "positive" for media & organic
## variables and "default" for all others. User can still customise signs if necessary.
## Documentation is available, access it anytime by running: ?robyn_inputs
InputCollect <- robyn_inputs(
dt_input = dt_simulated_weekly,
dt_holidays = dt_prophet_holidays,
date_var = "DATE", # date format must be "2020-01-01"
dep_var = "revenue", # there should be only one dependent variable
dep_var_type = "revenue", # "revenue" (ROI) or "conversion" (CPA)
prophet_vars = c("trend", "season", "holiday"), # "trend","season", "weekday" & "holiday"
prophet_country = "DE", # input country code. Check: dt_prophet_holidays

paid_media_vars = c("tv_S", "ooh_S", "print_S", "facebook_I", "search_clicks_P"), # mandatory.
# paid_media_vars must have same order as paid_media_spends. Use media exposure metrics like
# impressions, GRP etc. If not applicable, use spend instead.
organic_vars = "newsletter", # marketing activity without media spend
# factor_vars = c("events"), # force variables in context_vars or organic_vars to be categorical
window_start = "2016-01-01",
window_end = "2018-12-31",
adstock = "geometric" # geometric, weibull_cdf or weibull_pdf.
)
print(InputCollect)
#### 2a-2: Second, define and add hyperparameters
## Default media variable for modelling has changed from paid_media_vars to paid_media_spends.
## Also, calibration_input are required to be spend names.
## hyperparameter names are based on paid_media_spends names too. See right hyperparameter names:
hyper_names(adstock = InputCollect$adstock, all_media = InputCollect$all_media)
## Guide to setup & understand hyperparameters
## Robyn's hyperparameters have four components:
## - Adstock parameters (theta or shape/scale)
## - Saturation parameters (alpha/gamma)
## - Regularisation parameter (lambda). No need to specify manually
## - Time series validation parameter (train_size)
## 1. IMPORTANT: set plot = TRUE to create example plots for adstock & saturation
## hyperparameters and their influence in curve transformation.
plot_adstock(plot = FALSE)
plot_saturation(plot = FALSE)
## 2. Get correct hyperparameter names:
# All variables in paid_media_spends and organic_vars require hyperparameter and will be
# transformed by adstock & saturation.
# Run hyper_names(adstock = InputCollect$adstock, all_media = InputCollect$all_media)
# to get correct media hyperparameter names. All names in hyperparameters must equal
# names from hyper_names(), case sensitive. Run ?hyper_names to check function arguments.
## 3. Hyperparameter interpretation & recommendation:
## Geometric adstock: Theta is the only parameter and means fixed decay rate. Assuming TV
# spend on day 1 is 100€ and theta = 0.7, then day 2 has 100*0.7=70€ worth of effect
# carried-over from day 1, day 3 has 70*0.7=49€ from day 2 etc. Rule-of-thumb for common
# media genre: TV c(0.3, 0.8), OOH/Print/Radio c(0.1, 0.4), digital c(0, 0.3). Also,
# to convert weekly to daily we can transform the parameter to the power of (1/7),
# so to convert 30% daily to weekly is 0.3^(1/7) = 0.84.
## Weibull CDF adstock: The Cumulative Distribution Function of Weibull has two parameters,
# shape & scale, and has flexible decay rate, compared to Geometric adstock with fixed
# decay rate. The shape parameter controls the shape of the decay curve. Recommended
# bound is c(0, 2). The larger the shape, the more S-shape. The smaller, the more
# L-shape. Scale controls the inflexion point of the decay curve. We recommend very
# conservative bounce of c(0, 0.1), because scale increases the adstock half-life greatly.
# When shape or scale is 0, adstock will be 0.
## Weibull PDF adstock: The Probability Density Function of the Weibull also has two
# parameters, shape & scale, and also has flexible decay rate as Weibull CDF. The
# difference is that Weibull PDF offers lagged effect. When shape > 2, the curve peaks
# after x = 0 and has NULL slope at x = 0, enabling lagged effect and sharper increase and
# decrease of adstock, while the scale parameter indicates the limit of the relative
# position of the peak at x axis; when 1 < shape < 2, the curve peaks after x = 0 and has
# infinite positive slope at x = 0, enabling lagged effect and slower increase and decrease
# of adstock, while scale has the same effect as above; when shape = 1, the curve peaks at
# x = 0 and reduces to exponential decay, while scale controls the inflexion point; when
# 0 < shape < 1, the curve peaks at x = 0 and has increasing decay, while scale controls
# the inflexion point. When all possible shapes are relevant, we recommend c(0.0001, 10)
# as bounds for shape; when only strong lagged effect is of interest, we recommend
# c(2.0001, 10) as bound for shape. In all cases, we recommend conservative bound of
# c(0, 0.1) for scale. Due to the great flexibility of Weibull PDF, meaning more freedom
# in hyperparameter spaces for Nevergrad to explore, it also requires larger iterations
# to converge. When shape or scale is 0, adstock will be 0.
## Hill function for saturation: Hill function is a two-parametric function in Robyn with
# alpha and gamma. Alpha controls the shape of the curve between exponential and s-shape.
# Recommended bound is c(0.5, 3). The larger the alpha, the more S-shape. The smaller, the
# more C-shape. Gamma controls the inflexion point. Recommended bounce is c(0.3, 1). The
# larger the gamma, the later the inflection point in the response curve.
## Regularization for ridge regression: Lambda is the penalty term for regularised regression.
# Lambda doesn't need manual definition from the users, because it is set to the range of
# c(0, 1) by default in hyperparameters and will be scaled to the proper altitude with
# lambda_max and lambda_min_ratio.
## Time series validation: When ts_validation = TRUE in robyn_run(), train_size defines the
# percentage of data used for training, validation and out-of-sample testing. For example,
# when train_size = 0.7, val_size and test_size will be 0.15 each. This hyperparameter is
# customizable with default range of c(0.5, 0.8) and must be between c(0.1, 1).
## 4. Set individual hyperparameter bounds. They either contain two values e.g. c(0, 0.5),
# or only one value, in which case you'd "fix" that hyperparameter.
# Run hyper_limits() to check maximum upper and lower bounds by range
